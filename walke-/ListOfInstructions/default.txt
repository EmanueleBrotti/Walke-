-here you'll list all the valid instructions, separated by a line
-you can create other .txt files and if valid they will be read
-"=" is used for the program to know how many pieces the instruction requires, ignoring outputs
-for example, #FFFFFF AND #FF0000 = #000000 has 3 tokens (input1, instruction, input2)
-CLOCK = #000000 has only 1 token (instruction)
- each instruction requires an = to work properly and the instruction's name shouldn't have spaces.
-for example, #FFFFFF AND #FF0000 is not a valid instruction because it doesn't have a "="
-#FFFFFF SUM STUFF #FF0000 = #000000 is not a valid instruction because it has a " " between SUM and STUFF
